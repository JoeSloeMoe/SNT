Survival No Trader (SNT) 7DTD XML mod.
A mod balanced for game play without Traders.
This mod removes the ability to trade and get quests from Traders. Traders are still present in the world as part of the storyline, they just ignore you.

NOTE: As of version 2.0.3 Survival No Trader is bundled with both Learn By Use and Hybrid Learn By Use. See Installation instructions below to install.
Whats the difference between Learn By Use and Hybrid Learn By Use?
They both are different approaches to Learn by Use and which one you use depends on how you like to play the game. Both are fully supported and updated. The both have similar functionality e.,g. extra point when at max level.
