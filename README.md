# SNT
Survival No Trader (SNT) 7DTD XML mod.

This mod removes the ability to trade and get quests from Traders. It balances the game to reflect no trading or trader-questing. 
Traders are still present in the world as part of the storyline, they just ignore you.
Survival No Trader is not intended to be easier or harder than vanilla 7DTD, just slightly different. 
Some things are a bit easier, some things will be a bit harder.
