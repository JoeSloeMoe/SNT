You're exploring this area to find new sources of weapons and supplies. \nYou've heard rumours that this area is rich for the pickings, with both the Duke's gang and the Traders moving in to sift through whatever remains of civilisation. \nYour objectives are:\n - establish a base that can withstand zombie attacks as a foothold in the territory.\n - disrupt the Duke's supply chain. Strip the good loot without tipping them off to your presence.\n - identify Trader locations. Map out the extent of their presence and capabilites. Determine if they are friend or foe."
