Survival No Trader (SNT) 7DTD XML mod.

This mod removes the ability to trade and get quests from Traders. It balances the game to reflect no trading or trader-questing. 
Traders are still present in the world as part of the storyline, they just ignore you.
Survival No Trader is not intended to be easier or harder than vanilla 7DTD, just slightly different. 
Some things are a bit easier, some things will be a bit harder. 

Background: You are one of 4 siblings from the Harrington Clan out East. You run point for your crew.
Your family is engaged in an extended war and the war brings you here. You're exploring this area to find new sources of weapons and supplies. 
You've heard rumors that this area is rich for the pickings, with both the Duke's gang and the Traders moving in to sift through whatever remains of civilization. 
Your objectives are to:
 - establish a base that can withstand zombie attacks as a foothold for your clan in the territory.
 - disrupt the Duke's supply chain. Strip the good loot without tipping them off to your presence.
 - identify Trader locations. Map out the extent of their presence and capabilities. Determine if they are friend or foe.  
(The above is setting the stage for the eventual introduction of Bandits and Factions in 7DTD)

Changes and Additions:
*Includes the removal of all POI Names and Skulls (Khaine's code - link at end*)

Removed Trader Buy/Sell ability
Removed Trader opening and closing sounds, Trader will now just cough in an annoyed manner before kicking you out.

Added 2 mini challenges for unique one-of-a-kind end game items.  
	1) Missing Patrol Car - loot (lots of) Cop Cars with pickaxe for chance to kickstart. 
	2) Mary's Revenge - triggered at a 4000 Kill Streak, see buff below.
Added buff that tracks current zombie Kill Streak. Triggers Mary's Revenge at 4000. Counter resets on death.

Added craftable broodnest for birds. Looks and behaves the same as general ground nests for eggs and feathers.

Added small chance for Solar Panels in Airdrops and forced open Police Cars.

Small chance for a Bear to spawn in the Pine Forest (where else are they going to poop)
Small chance for a Dire Wolf to spawn in the Desert
Small increase in zombies in Desert, Snow and Wasteland biomes - relative to the biomes difficulty rating.
