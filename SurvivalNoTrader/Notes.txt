Survival No Trader (SNT) 7DTD XML mod. (JoeSLoeMoe)
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/34585-survival-no-trader/#comment-546720

A mod balanced for game play without Traders.
This mod removes the ability to trade and get quests from Traders. Traders are still present in the world as part of the storyline, they just ignore you.

Special thanks to FilUnderscore. This mod incorporates FilUnderscore's Improved Hordes mod (*see end for details).
Special thanks to Khaine. This mod contain some code from Kaine's modlets (**see end for details).

Background: You are one of 4 siblings from the Harrington Clan out East. You run point for your crew.
Your family is engaged in an extended war and the war brings you here. You're exploring this area to find new sources of weapons and supplies. 
You've heard rumors that this area is rich for the pickings, with both the Duke's gang and the Traders moving in to sift through whatever remains of civilization. 
Your objectives are to:
 - establish a base that can withstand zombie attacks as a foothold for your clan in the territory.
 - disrupt the Duke's supply chain. Strip the good loot without tipping them off to your presence.
 - identify Trader locations. Map out the extent of their presence and capabilities. Determine if they are friend or foe.  
(The above is setting the stage for the eventual introduction of Bandits and Factions in 7DTD)

Includes a small collection of stories and challenges that give a glimpse into the lives/deaths of other survivors.
    Grim Tales:
	1) Missing Patrol Car - break into a number of Cop Cars without lockpicking to engage. 
	2) Mary's Revenge - triggered at a 4000 Kill Streak. Kill Streak resets on death.
	3) Pigeons Carry Diseases - pigeons: some people hate them and some people absolutely adore them.
	4) Interloper - keeping your eyes and ears open can lead to interesting things.
	
	Grim Tales is also available as a standalone XML modlet:
