Mod Functionality (configurable in buffs.xml):

- For the Learn By Use Physician Skill, at max level receive a bonus skill point and Splints & Casts will heal sprains.
- Each Point invested in the default Perk give 20% more lbu_perk progression xp on kills. 
  e.g The Default for lbu_archery is each archery kill gives 24 progression xp. With 2 
  points in the Archery Perk (perkArchery) the progression xp is 28.8 (40% increase) per kill. 
- The more Experience using a tool or weapon you have the more you know how to maintain it.
  Each level of a LBU perk decreases associated tool/weapon degradation rate by 1% (total 50%).
  Doesnt apply to the Hidden Strike or Demolition perks.


WHY ARE THERE ONLY 50 LEVELS?
The mod is using 100 levels, it only calculates and displays every second level, so you see 50 in the UI.
For an detailed explanation, see the line "<!--NOTES on the level cap of 50--> in buffs.xml.

Config variables:
There are several Global Config variables to control the Learn-By-Use functionality. 
See buffs.xml, look for the line: "<!--PLAYER CONFIG VARIABLES..." for the variables and further information.

Multiplayer Notes:
 - Special thanks for Aramus for multiplayer testing.
 - Fully tested
 - Ranged Turrets do not work in multiplayer. Please see the comment line [START Multiplayer Turret Notes] in progression.xml to remove Turrets from Learn-By-Use if needed for multiplayer.

License:
The code is free to use license and commented as such. It is based on the Action Skill levelling algorithm from 
Khaine in the Darkness Falls mod (//community.7daystodie.com/topic/4941-darkness-falls-they-mostly-come-out-at-night/). 
Please acknowledge Khaine's coal-face work if you reuse the code.

  The best way to increase the Demolitions LBU perk is using grenades/rockets on large groups of zombies.

- Fixed Learn By Use progress error after using Grandpa's Fergit'n Elixir. 
  After using the Elixir, use any tool or weapon and a buff will restore all Learn By Use Perks' progress over a short period.
  Progress Level will also be restored when there are any other Perk Level changes e.g. infection side effects. 
  If you install this version over an existing install/game, you will see a message indicating the progress level is being verified, 
  this is just your local variables being updated to the latest version.
